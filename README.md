# Machine-learning based intrusion detection

## Downloading the Datasets

### 1999 DARPA Dataset
Download the [1999 DARPA IDS Dataset]() by running

```
cd data
./download_data.sh
```
This takes about 20 minutes (depending on your internet connection) and
downloads the inside and outside TCPDUMP files from the dataset (~18GB)
organized into training and test sets..
